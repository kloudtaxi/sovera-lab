##  PostgresRAGLoader: 

The `postgres-loader.py` script implements a PostgreSQL-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for managing sales data. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

## Core Features

1. **Database Initialization**

   - Creates necessary PostgreSQL tables for:
     - Customers
     - Sales People
     - Interactions
     - Opportunities
     - Document Embeddings
   - Sets up required indexes and the vector extension

2. **Data Loading and Embedding Generation**

   - Uses the 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model for generating embeddings
   - Processes and stores:
     - Customer data with embeddings of company and industry information
     - Interaction data with embeddings of notes and topics
   - Default embedding dimension: 384

3. **Search Capabilities**

   - **Semantic Search**: Performs vector similarity search across documents

   - Contextual Search

     : Allows filtered searches based on:

     - Customer ID
     - Date ranges
     - Similarity scores

## Key Components

### Tables Structure

- **customers**: Stores company information, industry, size, status
- **sales_people**: Manages sales team data and territories
- **interactions**: Records customer interactions, including notes and sentiment
- **opportunities**: Tracks sales opportunities and their status
- **document_embeddings**: Stores vector embeddings for RAG functionality

### Search Features

- Vector similarity search using cosine distance
- Configurable result limits
- Source type filtering
- Contextual filtering options

## Technical Details

- Uses asyncpg for asynchronous PostgreSQL operations
- Implements the SentenceTransformer model for embedding generation
- Utilizes PostgreSQL's vector extension for efficient similarity searches
- Supports JSONB for flexible metadata storage

The script serves as a crucial component in a sales management system, enabling both structured data storage and advanced semantic search capabilities through RAG implementation.
