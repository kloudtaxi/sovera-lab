## Data Generation Rules
These data generation rules provide a framework for creating realistic synthetic data with the following key features:

1. **Realistic Distributions**:
   - Company sizes follow market patterns
   - Industry concentrations match target markets
   - Sales cycles reflect real-world timelines
   - Performance metrics follow normal distributions

2. **Relationship Patterns**:
   - Contact roles appropriate to company size
   - Interaction frequency based on opportunity stage
   - Product combinations that make business sense
   - Realistic price points and discounts

3. **Temporal Patterns**:
   - Appropriate gaps between interactions
   - Realistic sales cycle lengths
   - Stage progression probabilities
   - Seasonal variations in activity

4. **Behavioral Patterns**:
   - Communication preferences by stage
   - Sentiment progression patterns
   - Response rates and timing
   - Cross-sell/upsell behaviors

To use these rules effectively, you would:
1. Start with company and contact generation
2. Assign sales reps based on territory/expertise matching
3. Generate opportunities with appropriate products
4. Create interaction sequences following the timing/frequency rules
5. Apply sentiment and outcome progressions
